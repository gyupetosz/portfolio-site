I studied computer engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics where I learned the foundations of programming through several coding languages. I specialised in computer graphics and created a VR game prototype in Unreal Engine for my thesis. I develop game projects exploring different technologies to expand on my game design pipeline. I aim to design beautiful and captivating virtual reality experiences.

							I procedurally approach complex design processes, which makes them easily scalable, makes their elements interchangeable and can speed up development greatly.
							During my projects, I familiarized myself with the foundations of game engines and 3d modeling and learned gameplay programming in C++, C# and blueprints.
							I use Houdini to approach designing and animating meshes and environments algorithmically for modeling.
							I delved into motion capture and character animation, utilizing metahumans, and created a hand movement recording system utulizing leap motion.
							Designing VR experiences requires a whole new approach to gameplay development.
							In my projects, I developed a physics-based hand interaction system, which creates realistic interactivity with the environment.

		       During the project I implemented the character movement and interaction system, setting up the Animation bluprint and retargeting the character's skeletal mesh.
		       I also contributed creating shaders, implementing interactive foliage, designing and programming gameplay systems and objectives.
		       I worked together with a sound designer implementig spatial sound effects and music for the game. I took on tasks related to gameplay design and supported the artists with technical art related tasks.

		      The logic was written in Blueprints extending the Unreal Engine VR template. Systems I implemented: Weapons, Enhanced physically accurate grabbing, Buttons and doors, Chests and Drawers, Enemy and turret AI, continous locomotion, enhanced granade throwing and gravity grabbing.
		      During implementation I aimed to recreat an interaction system similar to Half-Life Alyx.

                         In this project, I learned how to create a procedural environment.
						 The landscape was formed with the help of layer masks and noise deformation.
						 I utilized Houdini's erodation simulation tool which assigned material layers.
						 I used these material layers to create the landscape material with unreal.
						 The scattering of foliage and trees was done procedurally too.
						 I made a grass deform system that masks the player's path and on the shader deforms foliage.
						 I also implemented a physics-based foliage system and created physics assets for interactable objects.
						 In blueprints, I wrote code for a magic system to attack and assemble objects. There is an enemy ai in the game as well. 
						 The animation of the mushrooms and trees was done procedurally in Houdini with noise. Later, I exported the skeletal mesh-based animations as a vertex animation to run on the shader more optimally.
						 The bridge assembly animation was an exported Houdini simulation.
						 The hand animation during the assembly was recorded with an ultraleap and later retargeted to the hand mesh using Houdini.
			    			 During this project, I deepened my understanding of environmental design, procedural modeling, shader creation, animating meshes and creating interactive environment elements.

                       I developed an immersive VR sword-fighting endless runner game using Unreal Engine’s Blueprints, where players navigate through an infinite world, engaging in dynamic combat by throwing swords at approaching enemies.
		       The game features an endless, procedurally generated environment that keeps players constantly on the move, combined with intuitive sword-throwing mechanics for precise targeting and elimination of foes.
		       Utilizing Blueprints for all game logic, I ensured a visually driven development process that enhances both performance and maintainability. I coded a basic enemy AI and throughout the development process, I brainstormed and outlined core mechanics, created prototypes to test and refine gameplay, and conducted playtesting to optimize performance and refine the player experience.
		       I addressed performance issues to make it run in VR smoothly, fine-tuned VR interactions to make it intuitive for the player and balanced the difficulty to make it engaging.

		       The hand animations are recorded with the help of a leap motion and the animation is retargeted to the skeleton.
		       The character was custom-made, combining several meshes, texturing it in Substance Painter, and rigging it in Blender.
		       I combined the mesh from custom elements, modified a metahuman face, and rigged the character mesh to support the epic skeleton.
		       To blend the recorded animations I made animation retargets and animation blueprints transferring the animation data onto the skeletal mesh. 
		       I aim to incorporate storytelling in my upcoming works and this project is foundational in that.

                        I created a physics-based VR interaction system for an escape room prototype.
						The hands are physics-based so you can't overlap with game objects even if the player's controller's position would be inside something.
						I created physics interactable objects and implemented a movement system for the character.
						The grabbing system is physics-based also, if the player applies too much force to the object in the hand it falls out.
						The custom hand mesh was made up of originally 1 million polygons and I managed to reduce it algorithmically to 30k.
						To bring the hand mesh alive, I made animations and poses for it, which are blended in an Animation Blueprint.
						For the glasses, I implemented a destruction system to make it breakable.
			    			During this project, I learned blueprint programming, prototyping gameplay systems, and utilizing physics-based logic in the engine.
			    			This project serves as a VR interaction framework for future projects, giving a platform for realistic simulated experiences.
