                    Hello, I'm Peter Gyugos. I studied computer engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics where I learned the foundations of programming through several coding languages. I specialised in computer graphics and created a VR game prototype in Unreal Engine for my thesis. I develop indie VR game projects and with every project, I further my understanding of gameplay programming and design tools.

                            I'm passionate about capturing the imagination with the help of technology. 
							I aspire to create visually stunning interactive experiences, and I aim to excel in the technologies necessary to make those. 
							I procedurally approach complex design processes, which makes them easily scalable, makes their elements interchangeable and can speed up development greatly.
							During my projects, I familiarized myself with the foundations of game engines and 3d modelling and learned gameplay programming in C++, C# and blueprints.
							For modelling, I use Houdini to algorithmically approach designing and animating meshes and environments.
							Designing VR experiences requires a whole new approach to gameplay development.
							In my projects, I developed a physics-based hand interaction system, which creates realistic interactivity with the environment.

                         In this project, I learned how to create a procedural environment.
						 The landscape was formed with the help of layer masks and noise deformation.
						 I utilized Houdini's erodation simulation tool which assigned material layers.
						 I used these material layers to create the landscape material with unreal.
						 The scattering of foliage and trees was done procedurally too.
						 I made a grass deform system that masks the player's path and on the shader deforms foliage.
						 I also implemented a physics-based foliage system and created physics assets for interactable objects.
						 In blueprints, I wrote code for a magic system to attack and assemble objects. There is an enemy ai in the game as well. 
						 The animation of the mushrooms and trees was done procedurally in Houdini with noise. Later, I exported the skeletal mesh-based animations as a vertex animation to run on the shader more optimally.
						 The bridge assembly animation was an exported Houdini simulation.
						 The hand animation during the assembly was recorded with an ultraleap and later retargeted to the hand mesh using Houdini.

                        I created a physics-based VR interaction system for an escape room prototype.
						The hands are physics-based so you can't overlap with game objects even if the player's controller's position would be inside something.
						I created physics interactable objects and implemented a movement system for the character.
						The grabbing system is physics-based also, if the player applies too much force to the object in the hand it falls out.
						The custom hand mesh was made up of originally 1 million polygons and I managed to reduce it algorithmically to 30k.
						To bring the hand mesh alive, I made animations and poses for it, which are blended in an Animation Blueprint.
						For the glasses, I implemented a destruction system to be breakable.

						There is a physics-based hand and interaction system for the project, with weapons and enemies and with some basic puzzle elements.
						I made a gravity-modifying gun to interact with a larger object, animated it and implemented a projectile system, to be able to shoot.
						I modelled the towers in the maze procedurally so their height can be adjusted with a parameter.
						I also implemented a gravity grab function which makes it possible to grab up objects from a distance.
